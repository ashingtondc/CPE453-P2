Questions:

1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
When each job has the same burst time, SRTN will deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO. 

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
For workloads with jobs with varying burst times, low quantum lengths will deliver the same response times as SRTN. 

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
Based on what the simulator shows, response times increase a lot when every job's length is increased, since each job has to wait
for the jobs before to complete before being started and "responding."

4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
Response times increase as quantum lengths increase. The final job in the queue will have to wait for each job before it to go through its allocated quantum
before it can respond. The equation looks like Response_time = (N-1)*Q.
